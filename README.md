- **Adjustable Difficulty**: Choose from three difficulty levels—Easy, Medium, and Hard—to match your skill level.
- **Score Tracking**: Keep track of your score and compete with friends to see who can achieve the highest score.
- **Simple Controls**: Use the 'W', 'A', 'S', 'D' keys to move the snake up, left, down, and right, respectively. Press 'X' to exit the game.
